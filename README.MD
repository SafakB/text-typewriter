**Author:** Safak Bahce

## Description

This script applies a typewriter effect to any HTML element with the 'typewriter' class. It uses the 'data-text' attribute for the text to type out and the 'data-speed' attribute to set the typing speed. If these attributes are not provided, it uses a default text and speed (100ms).

## How to Use

1. Include the `typewriter.js` script in your HTML file.
2. Add the 'typewriter' class to any HTML element that you want to apply the typewriter effect to.
3. Optionally, you can add the 'data-text' and 'data-speed' attributes to set the text and typing speed. If not provided, the default text and speed will be used.

Example:

```html
<div class="typewriter" data-text="Hello, world!" data-speed="100"></div>
```
